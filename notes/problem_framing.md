# Problem framing



India wants to reach net-zero while still giving everyone cheap and reliable electricity by 2047. This is not easy because no single energy source can do everything on its own.
So instead of picking one "best" energy source, we look at how different sources can work together. In this project, we think of major energy technologies as players in a game. These players are not companies or people, they are just different ways of producing power.
We focus on 4–5 main players: nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, and coal with CCUS as a transition option. Each player decides how much share it should have in India’s 2047 electricity mix.
The objective is two fold. First, we want to understand how nuclear energy might evolve after the SHANTI Bill, since this policy can make nuclear easier to expand and more important for clean baseload power. Second, we study how nuclear and renewable energy can work togather in a synergistic way to move towards net-zero without hurting reliability or cost.
Overall, this is framed as a cooperative game, where all players try to achieve the best outcome for the country, not to compete with each other. The goal is to find a balanced energy mix that is affordable, clean, and reliable for India’s future.
